DESCRIPTION : 

AlgoLearn helps computer science students master algorithms through interactive visualizations and gamified challenges. Students watch step-by-step Canvas animations of sorting algorithms (Bubble, Quick, Merge, Heap) with playback controls (play, pause, step-forward, step-backward, speed adjustment), then test understanding through prediction quizzes and multiple-choice challenges. The platform tracks progress, awards achievements for milestones, and features leaderboards to motivate learning. Unlike passive visualizers or textbook diagrams, AlgoLearn combines visual learning with active testing, helping students internalize algorithm behavior rather than just memorizing steps.

USER PERSONAS : 

Max (Struggling CS Student) : Has trouble understanding recursion and Big O notation from textbooks, needs visual step-by-step breakdowns with controllable pacing.Mike (Interview Prep Candidate) : Preparing for technical interviews, discovers which algorithms they've memorized versus truly mastered.

USER STORIES : 

1. Algorithm Visualization Engine - by Deeksha Manjunatha Bankapur
As a student, I want to select from a library of sorting algorithms categorized by difficulty, so I can learn at my current level.As a student, I want to watch animations to see how the algorithm executes step-by-step.As a student, I want playback controls  so I explore algorithm behavior at my own pace.As a student, I want to generate random input arrays of different sizes, so I test algorithm performance with various data patterns.As a student, I want to see pseudocode with the current line highlighted, so I connect visual animation to code logic.As a student, I want to view complexity analysis so I understand algorithm efficiency.

2. Progress & Challenges - by Shriya Yarrapureddy Sarath 
As a student, I want to complete interactive quizzes on time complexity and algorithm behavior, so I test my understanding.As a student, I want to answer prediction challenges about array states after specific steps, so I validate my knowledge with immediate feedback.As a student, I want a dashboard showing completed algorithms, quiz scores, and time spent, so I track progress and stay motivated.As a student, I want to see my learning streak, so I'm encouraged to maintain consistent practice.As a student, I want to earn achievements for milestones (completing all algorithms, perfect scores), so I can feel accomplished by what I have truly mastered.
